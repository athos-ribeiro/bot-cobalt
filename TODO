## TODO

Core:

  - Drop File::Spec, use Path::Tiny

  - ::Common refactor, see notes in branch type-tiny

  - Stylistic cleanups:
    * has 'foo' -> has foo
    * attrib option indentation consistency
    * lowercase-only attribs (w/ backwards-compat MooX::Aliases)


  - Try to make sure coreset plugins are rehash-safe

Needs testing:
  - Dynamic context add / rehash / !server connect
  - !server disconnect

bin/:

  - langset update tool

::Plugins:

  - Plugins::Extras::BanMgr
    Channel ban manager plugin

  - Plugins::ChanMgr
    Online channels.conf manager

  - Plugins::Extras::Logger
    Configurable log-to-file plugin
