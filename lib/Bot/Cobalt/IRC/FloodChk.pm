=head1 NAME

Bot::Cobalt::IRC::FloodChk - Flood check utils for Bot::Cobalt

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $flood = Bot::Cobalt::IRC::FloodChk->new(
    count => 5,
    in    => 4,
  );
  
  ## Incoming IRC message, f.ex
  ## Throttle user to 5 messages in 4 seconds
  if ( $flood->check( $context, $nick ) ) {
    ## Flood detected
  } else {
    ## No flood, continue
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a fairly generic flood control manager intended for 
L<Bot::Cobalt::IRC> (although it can be used anywhere you'd like to rate 
limit messages).

=head2 new

The object's constructor takes two mandatory parameters, B<count> and 
B<in>, indicating that B<count> messages (or events, or whatever) are 
allowed in a window of B<in> seconds.

=head2 check

  $flood->check( $context, $key );

If there appears to be a flood in progress, returns the number of 
seconds until it would be permissible to process more events.

Returns boolean false if there is no flood detected.

=head2 clear

Clear the tracked state for a specified context and key; if the key is 
omitted, the entire context is cleared.

=head2 expire

Check all contexts and keys in the object for stale entries that can be 
safely removed; in other words, entries whose latest recorded event was 
more than the specified B<in> seconds ago.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Algorithm is borrowed from an excellent article regarding 
L<Algorithm::FloodControl>; for a more generic rate limiting solution, 
try there.
