## Cobalt::Plugin::Info3 config
##
## The Info3 plugin provides darkbot-alike "info topics"
## These are IRC responses triggered by simple glob strings.
##
## FIXME link to info3 docs containing info on var repl etc


Opts:
  ## The Info3 database is stored as a BerkDB.
  ## (Windows users will need a working DB_File!)
  ## 'InfoDB:' should be a path relative to the bot's /var:
  InfoDB: db/info3.db


#### Access controls ####

RequiredLevels:

  ## Required levels to add/delete info topics.
  AddTopic: 2
  DelTopic: 2
  
  ## A 'dsearch' (deep search) can be a bit intensive on a large DB.
  ## By default, any user can make use of dsearch
  ## You may want to tweak this to prevent abuse.
  DeepSearch: 0
