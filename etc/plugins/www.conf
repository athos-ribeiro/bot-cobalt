## Plugin::WWW config
## 
## The 'WWW' plugin handles asynchronous HTTP for Web-enabled plugins.
## You probably want this loaded, else some plugins may silently fail.
##
## For most configurations, the defaults here should be fine.

Opts:
  ## Maximum number of HTTP workers to spawn at a time.
  ## One is spawned per request; if MaxWorkers is reached, requests are 
  ## queued until one of the previously forked workers is done.
  ##
  ## Defaults to 5.
  MaxWorkers: 5

  ## A local IP to bind to for outgoing connections.
  ## (Default uses INADDR_ANY)
  BindAddr: ~

  ## A HTTP proxy to use, in the form of ADDRESS:PORT
  ##  f.ex some.http.proxy:8080
  Proxy: ~

  ## HTTP request timeout.
  Timeout: 60
