## Plugin::WWW config
## 
## The 'WWW' plugin handles asynchronous HTTP for Web-enabled plugins.
## You probably want this loaded, else some plugins may silently fail.
##
## For most configurations, the defaults here should be fine.

Opts:

  ## A local IP to bind to for outgoing connections.
  BindAddr: ~

  ## A HTTP proxy to use, in the form of ADDRESS:PORT
  Proxy: ~

  ## HTTP request timeout.
  Timeout: 60
